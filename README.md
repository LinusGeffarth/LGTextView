## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

- Swift 4.2
- iOS 8+
- Xcode 8+

## Installation

LGTextView is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'LGTextView'
```

## Usage

To use an `LGTextView`, simply drag a regular `UITextView` into your storyboard, and set its class to `LGTextView`. You'll then be able to enter the placeholder of your choice.
Alternatively, you can create an `LGTextView` with placeholder in code, as follows:

    textView.placeholder = "Put some fancy placeholder here ðŸ’¥"
